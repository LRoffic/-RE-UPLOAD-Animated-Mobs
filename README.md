    The look of zombies, creepers, and other mobs can be boring over time. 
    <strong>Animated Mobs Resource Pack</strong> provides many facial expressions to some Minecraft mobs. This Texture Pack makes the mobs much more realistic and gives them a touch of liveliness. This Resource Pack is compatible with Minecraft versions 1.14.X and 1.15.X.(Just few mobs will not have textures animated for higher versions but keep vanilla texture). It should be noted that this Texture Pack only works with <a href="https://optifine.net/" target="_blank"><u>Optifine</u></a>. As this Texture Pack is no more updated by the author and i'm not designer, i just can't update it but i want to re-upload it 'cause is one of my favorite et i want to share it for everybody. If you like it and want to contribute, feel free to send me a pull request.
