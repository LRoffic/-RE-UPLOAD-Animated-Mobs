    <strong>New facial expressions in the Nether</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    With the new version of Animated Mobs, the Nether is more lifelike than ever thanks to animated textures. The new creatures like Hoglins or Piglins can move their eyes and blink. With large lava lakes, you quickly come across striders, who can open their mouths and also wink with their eyes. When a Strider has no more lava under his feet, he not only starts to tremble, but his mouth also starts to rattle clearly!
